# 🔐 Malicious File Upload Detection Engine

A **production-style security project** that detects and blocks malicious file uploads using **defense-in-depth** techniques. This project demonstrates how real-world applications protect against **extension spoofing, MIME confusion, and known malware signatures**.

---

## 📌 Features

* ✅ Secure file upload handling (Flask)
* ✅ File size limits
* ✅ Extension allow-listing
* ✅ **MIME ↔ Extension validation** using `libmagic`
* ✅ **YARA-based malware signature detection**
* ✅ Quarantine mechanism for suspicious files
* ✅ Structured **security logging & audit trail**
* ✅ Safe testing using EICAR and shell-based samples

## ⚙️ Setup Instructions

### 1️⃣ Clone Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/malicious-file-upload-detector.git
cd malicious-file-upload-detector
```
### 📢 You can skip step 2 on windows but on linux you need an virtual environment 

### 2️⃣ Create Virtual Environment

```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```

### 3️⃣ Install System Dependencies

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install -y libmagic1 yara
```

### 4️⃣ Install Python Dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 5️⃣ Run the Application

```bash
python app.py
```

Open browser:

## 🧪 Testing Guide

### I have included test files folder cointaing real and fake files so feel free to check the functionality

## 🔐 Threat Model & Security Notes

### Covered Threats

* Extension spoofing (`.exe → .pdf`)
* Script-based malware
* Known malware signatures
* MIME confusion attacks

### Limitations

* Does not detect zero-day malware
* No dynamic/sandbox execution
* No macro or encrypted PDF analysis

---


## 🚀 Future Enhancements

* Dockerization
* Rate limiting & abuse prevention
* Hash-based reputation checks
* PDF macro analysis
* Or if any enhancements feel free to reach out...
